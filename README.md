Vimeo has a huge repository of some great videos, and the good thing is you can download these videos to your devices for offline use. We’ll show you exactly how to save Vimeo videos on your desktop and mobile devices.

## Download Vimeo Videos on Desktop


* On a Windows, Mac, Linux, or Chromebook computer, use the Vimeo site to download videos.
* Start by opening a web browser on your computer and launching the Vimeo site, then find the video you’d like to download. Click that video so it starts playing.
* Scroll down the page and, beneath the video title, click the small “Download” button.
* You’ll see a “Download” window. Here, select the quality in which you want to download your video. Then, next to that quality option, click “Download.”
* Your desktop’s usual “save” window will open. In this window, select a folder to save your video in and save the video.
* And you’ve successfully saved a Vimeo video for offline use on your desktop. You can now play this downloaded video file, edit it, move it to your other devices, and do what you’d normally do with a video file.


## Download Vimeo Videos on Mobile

* To save Vimeo videos for offline use on your iPhone, iPad, or Android phone, use the official Vimeo app.
* Launch the Vimeo app on your phone and tap “Watch” at the bottom. Find the video you’d like to download and tap it so it starts playing.
* On the video page, in the top-right corner, tap the three dots.
* From the three-dots menu, select “Make Available Offline.”
* Vimeo will start downloading the selected video to your phone. Once it’s downloaded, you will find it in Watch > Offline section of the Vimeo app.
* The “Offline” section displays all your downloaded videos.
* And that’s how you use the official option to save videos from Vimeo to your desktop and mobile. Happy watching!
